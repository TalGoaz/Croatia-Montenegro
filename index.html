	<h1>Vacation in Croatia & Montenegro</h1>

	<p>In 2019, I had the unforgettable opportunity to travel through the stunning coastlines of Croatia and the serene landscapes of Montangero. 
		<br>Croatia dazzled me with its crystal-clear Adriatic waters, charming stone towns like Dubrovnik and Split, and the vibrant energy of summer festivals and seaside cafés.
		<br>The warmth of the people and the rich cultural history made every stop feel like a storybook come to life.
		<br>After soaking up the sun and sea, Montangero offered a perfect contrast, peaceful, green, and tucked away from the bustle, it was a place to slow down and breathe deeply.</br>
		Quiet walks, local food, and simplicity of life there made it feel like a hidden gem, and the combination of both places left me with memories I’ll carry forever.

		Dubrovnik, known as the “Pearl of the Adriatic,” was a highlight of my trip. 
		<br>Its ancient walls and stunning Old Town were not only rich in history but also famously served as King’s Landing in Game of Thrones. 
		<br>Walking through the narrow stone streets and along the city walls felt like stepping into a fantasy world,
		<br>with breathtaking views of the sea and medieval architecture all around.

		Lozovac was a peaceful escape surrounded by nature, and it served as the perfect gateway to Krka National Park.
		<br> The small village had a quiet charm, with friendly locals and a laid-back atmosphere that made it easy to relax.
		<br> From there, I explored the stunning waterfalls and lush trails of Krka, just a short drive away. 
		<br>Lozovac felt like a hidden gem—simple, calm, and the ideal place to recharge between adventures.

		During my time in Split, Dalmatia, I was captivated by the blend of ancient history and stunning coastal scenery. 
		<br>The vibrant streets, Roman ruins, and lively waterfront made every day feel like an adventure.
		<br>One of the highlights was taking a boat trip to a remote island, where we spent the afternoon sunbathing on quiet beaches and exploring a mysterious 
		blue cave glowing with otherworldly light—an unforgettable escape into nature’s magic.

		Wandering through the narrow, stone-paved streets of Stari Grad Kotor felt like stepping into a medieval fairytale.
		<br>Surrounded by ancient walls and dramatic mountain backdrops, the old town was full of charm, with cozy cafés, hidden courtyards, and centuries-old churches at every turn. 
		<br>Climbing the fortress above the city rewarded us with breathtaking views of the bay—a perfect blend of history, beauty, and adventure.

		Exploring Durmitor National Park was like diving into a wild, untouched world of natural beauty. 
		<br>Towering peaks, deep canyons, and glacial lakes created a landscape that felt both dramatic and peaceful. 
		<br>We hiked through pine forests, crossed rustic wooden bridges, and even spotted a few wild mountain goats along the way.
		<br>The crisp air and breathtaking views made every step feel like a moment of pure freedom.

		<p>
		Visiting Ostrog Monastery was a truly awe-inspiring experience. Carved directly into a sheer cliffside high above the Zeta Valley, 
		<br>this 17th-century Serbian Orthodox monastery is one of the most unique and sacred pilgrimage sites in the Balkans. 
		<br>The white facade seemed to glow against the rock, and stepping inside felt like entering a spiritual refuge frozen in time. 
		<br>Despite its remote location, the monastery was filled with quiet reverence, offering panoramic views and a powerful sense of peace
		<br> that stayed with me long after we left.
